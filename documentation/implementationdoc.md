# Implementation Document

## Project Structure

The application is split into three parts: Graphical User Interface, AI and the main file running the game loop. A separate directory has been made for unit testing, and another test file for performance testing is located together with the main file.

## Implemented time and space complexities

Currently the time complexity of the minimax function is O^n as expected.
