# Week 6 (June 19th - June 25th)

## Progress Made

* Fixed check_win working incorrectly with rising diagonals.
* Refactored the gameboard and pieces from strings to integers.
* choose_column first reviews the move that was optimal during the previous depth iteration.
* Added many more tests to thoroughly test check_win, and tests that minimax recognizes wins two and five moves away.

## Problems and Questions

* I am having trouble reordering moves within the minimax function's loops.

## Next Steps
