# Week 2 (May 22nd - May 28th)

## Progress Made

* Unittests have been made for UI, game logic and integration between the two.
* The game checks for victory after every move.
* Game logic and UI have been separated into modules.


This week I have begun testing, and learned how to check for console outputs in testing as well with StringIO.
