# Week 2 (May 22nd - May 28th)

## Progress Made

* Unittests have been made for UI, game logic and integration tests have been made for them.
* Test branch coverage reports can be made and viewed.
* Pylint has been implemented to check code.
* The game checks for victory after every move.
* Game logic and UI have been separated into modules.
* Added a computer opponent who drops pieces randomly.
* Begin implementing minimax-algorithm for the AI.


This week I have begun testing, and learned how to check for console outputs in testing as well with StringIO. I also received good practice with modularizing code from one file to multiple.
